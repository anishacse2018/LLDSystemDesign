/*
Design a system for managing a restaurant. The system should handle the following
functionalities:
● Allow the restaurant admin to define the number of tables.
● Allow restaurant admin to add, update, or remove items from the menu. Each menu item
should have attributes such as name, price, veg / non-veg and category (starter, main
course, dessert).
● Allow customers to browse the menu and allow filtering on factors (veg / non-veg,
category), add items to their order, specify quantities, and place the order.
● Allow restaurant admin to manage tables in the restaurant as in number of tables.
● Calculate the total bill for each order, including taxes and any additional charges.
Provide options for customers to pay the bill via various payment options, such as cash,
credit/debit card, or online payment (card payment levy additional charges).
Bonus Functionality:
● Provide a system for kitchen staff to view incoming orders, mark them as prepared, and
notify wait-staff when orders are ready for serving.
● Allow multiple orders for the same table (AddItems even after 1 order was placed)
